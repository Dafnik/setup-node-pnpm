## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability in setup-node-pnpm (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn't be possible), you can reach us at <security@dafnik.me>.

You should _not_ report such issues on GitHub or in other public spaces to give us time to publish a fix for the issue without exposing setup-node-pnpm's users to increased risk.

## Scope

A "vulnerability in setup-node-pnpm" is a vulnerability in the code distributed through our main source code repository on GitHub. Vulnerabilities that are specific to a given installation (e.g. misconfiguration) should be reported to the owner of that installation and not us.
